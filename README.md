# -SENTIMENTAL-ANALYSIS-OF-AMAZON-REVIEWS
As a student at the School of Computing and Computer Engineering, I conducted a project on Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews under the guidance of Dr. Andrew Sung. Using advanced NLP algorithms like TextBlob and VADER, we categorized reviews as favorable or hostile, revealing the complex interplay of sentiment and consumer behavior in e-commerce. The project highlighted the importance of sentiment analysis in shaping product perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. By analyzing sentiment, organizations can customize their goods, services, and marketing plans to meet customer expectations in the fast-paced digital economy. The project's progress included implementing sentiment analysis, analyzing consensus and divergence between tools, and evaluating accuracy against true labels, demonstrating the models' effectiveness.As a student at the School of Computing and Computer Engineering, I conducted a project on Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews under the guidance of Dr. Andrew Sung.
